class Percept():
    '''The purpose of percepts is to convey information that may translate into experiences for agents. Percepts need to be able to convey arbitrary information, including mutable state. Percepts are digested by an agent's perception filter that translates the information in the percept into the agent's inner ontology.

    This base Percept class can be subclassed in order to endow percepts with methods that are convenienmt for the implementation of an agent's idiosyncratic perception filter.'''
