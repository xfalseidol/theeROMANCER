Deliberate actions are always deterministic, but deterministic actions are not necessarily deliberate. For example, some agents can move just as vehicles can, and some of those movements can be deterministic from a simulation standpoint while not being deliberate. E.g., if an agent represents a falling person, their physical shift to a different disposition as they fell would be deterministic (in that it can be predicted to occur ast a specific future time) but not deliberate in that the agent may not have planned to fall and may not be aware it is falling. The PersonLikeAgent might invoke either its reasoner or amygdala to determine this action.'''
